Applied stochastic optimization problems

In the fall of 2021, I started a part-time graduate degree in mathematical and computational finance at the University of Montreal. For my first semester, I took the ITF6512 "Stochastic Programming" course, for which I have had to complete several homework assignments that I have decided to publish here.

Files:
- "L-shaped_algorithm_JULIA.ipynb" -> (Julia language) implements the multicut L-shaped algorithm to solve a two-stage stochastic optimization problem
- more coming, can't publish the others just yet...
