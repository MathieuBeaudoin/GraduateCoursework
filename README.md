Applied stochastic optimization problems

In the fall of 2021, I started a part-time graduate degree in mathematical and computational finance at the University of Montreal. For my first semester, I took the ITF6512 "Stochastic Programming" course, for which I have had to complete several homework assignments that I have decided to publish here.

Files:
- "L-shaped_algorithm_JULIA.ipynb" -> (Julia language) implements the multicut L-shaped algorithm to solve a two-stage stochastic optimization problem
- "Retrospective_Approximation_JULIA.ipynb" -> (Julia language) implements Monte Carlo approximation using the "retrospective approximation" variant of the sample average approximation approach
- "Importance_Sampling_PYTHON.ipynb" -> (Python language) implements a Monte Carlo optimization on real electricity production/usage data, comparing "naive" sampling to an approach proposed by Dantzig and Glynn in 1990, "importance" sampling
